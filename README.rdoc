= Striuct

* http://github.com/kachick/striuct
* https://rubygems.org/gems/striuct
* http://rubyforge.org/projects/striuct

== DESCRIPTION

Striuct means Strict Struct.
Handy and safty than Ruby's Standard Struct.

== FEATURES
* Provides automated checking for your setters.
  When you link a object, Striuct checks "They are valid objects?".
  These checkers are not only Type Checker. They judge under your expressions.
* After check, you can add one-step before link a object (call "flavor" at here).
* You will be set default-value, and we have different meanings between nil and default-value.
* without undesirable naming for conflict, no-identifier, and more cases
* Base API looks like Ruby's standard Struct
* pure-ruby and not taint your name-space

== SYNOPSIS

* setup
    require 'striuct'

* Macro "member" provides one of Struct+ interface.
  It checks under conditions when change to link other.
    class User < Striuct.new
      member :id, Integer
      member :address, /\A((\w+) ?)+\z/
      member :age, (20..140)
      member :name, /\A\w+\z/, /\A\w+ \w+\z/
    end

    # pass
    user = User.new 128381, 'Tokyo Japan', 20

    # pass
    user.age = 30
    user.name = 'taro yamada'

    # fail
    user[:id] = 10.0
    user[1] = 'Tokyo-to'
    user.age = 19
    user.name = nil

* more detail checker do you need, you can use functional object here.
    module Game
      class Character
      end

      class DB < Striuct.new
        member :monsters, ->monsters{(monsters - characters).empty?}
        member :characters, ->characters{characters.all?{|c|c.kind_of? Character}}
      end
      
      monster = Character.new
      db = DB.new
      
      # fail
      db.characters = [1, 2]
      
      # pass
      db.characters = [monster, Character.new]
      
      # fail
      db.monsters = [:dummy]
      
      # pass
      db.monsters = [monster]
    end

* with flavor for type cast
    class User2 < Striuct.new
      member :age, /\A\d+\z/, Numeric do |arg|
        Integer arg
      end
      
      member :name, ->v{v.respond_to? :to_str} do |v|
        v.to_str.to_sym
      end
    end
    
    user2 = User2.new
    user2.age = 9 #=> 9(Fixnum)
    user2.age = 10.1 #=> 10(Fixnum)
    user2.age = '10' #=> 10(Fixnum)

    user2.name = 's' #=> :10(Symbol)

* but, linked objects are able to clash
    user.strict? #=> true
    user.address.clear
    user.strict? #=> false

* use default value
    class User3 < Striuct.new
      member  :lank, Fixnum
      default :lank, 3
      member  :name
    end
    
    user3 = User3.new
    user3.lank #=> 3
    
* Standard Struct always define "nil is default". ...realy?
   user3.name  #=> nil
   user3.assign? :name #=> false
   user3.name = nil
   user3.assign? :name #=> true

* Standard Struct no check member name. 
    NoGuard = Struct.new :__send__, :'?  !'
    noguard = NoGuard.new false
    p noguard.__send__
    p noguard.methods.include?(:'?  !') # lost!!

* Striuct provides safety levels for naming.
    class SafetyNaming < Striuct.new
      begin
        member :__send__
      rescue
        p $!
      end
      
      begin
        member :'?  !'
      rescue
        p $!
      end
      
      protect_level :struct
      
      member :__send__, :'?  !'
    end


* Of course, keeping Struct's good interface
    Sth1 = Striuct.new :id, :last_name, :family_name, :address, :age

    Sth2 = Striuct.new do
      def my_special_method
      end
    end
    
    Sth2.new.respond_to?(:my_special_method) #=> true

* (see example.rb)

* Here, not taint your name-space. but enhancers are too, you can choose it.
    require 'striuct/import'

* and more added

* and adding
